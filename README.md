# PW-Encoding Tool

Password encryption is a critical aspect of securing user credentials in software applications. Storing passwords in plaintext is a significant security risk because if unauthorized access occurs, the passwords can be easily exposed. Instead, passwords should be hashed or encrypted using secure algorithms.
The purpose of the script is to mitigate brute force & dictionary attacks via encoding.
