Mac Spoofing Tool

A MAC spoofer, or MAC address spoofer, is a tool or technique used to alter the Media Access Control (MAC) address of a network interface on a device. MAC spoofing involves changing the MAC address of a network interface to impersonate another device or to generate a random, non-identifying MAC address. This process is also known as MAC address cloning.
